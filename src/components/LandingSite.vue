    <h1>The Institute of the Cosmos</h1>
    <p>
      The Institute of the Cosmos is an ongoing collective research project
      founded in 2019. Informed by the historical ideas of Russian Cosmism, the
      Institute is a space for a creative investigation of the materiality of
      the cosmos and its strange universalism, from the perspectives of
      philosophy, anthropology, history of science, and art.
